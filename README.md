MobileGeeks Chrome Extension
===================

## What is it?
Just a simple, fan-made and basic Google Chrome extension to get the latest news of [ mobilegeeks.de][mg-link]. It's a slow, but ongoing project which I use to play around with Chrome extensions and / or Javascript.

## How it looks
The extension looks like:

## How to install
Open Chrome, go to `chrome://extensions/` and enable the 'Developer mode'. Afterwards, click on `Load unpacked extension`. Choose the cloned folder and import it. Done. I won't provide a Chrome App Store version of this extension.

## Should be done
Due to the 'playground' character of this project, there's a huge list of things that should be done or fixed or implemented.

**My personal list**

* UI improvments
* Implement local storage
* Implement background refreshing
* Implement new fancy features

## Thanks to
Let me thank at first Google. Its hard to code without at least one search request. Last, but not least: Thank you Stackoverflow for all their helpful answers.
